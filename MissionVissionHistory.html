                    Origin Taekwondo Academy The Black Tigers, is driven by the zeal of its Founder Samuel Ngigi. The journey of the establishment of the Academy was full of hurdles and adventures. But those obstacles were nothing in comparison to the determination and dedication of the founder. There is a saying that <em><strong>“If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door”</strong></em>, he indeed opened the door of opportunities for the students of Origin Taekwondo to excel in martial Arts and self-defense techniques along with their various studies.

                    The journey of the foundation of <em><strong>Origin Taekwondo Academy </strong></em> began around 2019 when Samuel Ngigi started training many students, unofficially though but effectively. Months of efforts resulted in the administration taking note of the efforts and achievements of the students. 15th May 2019, was the red-letter day to pave the way for the establishment of the Academy as the astounding foundation of the Academy took place on this propitious day by the unforgettable efforts of founders of the academy along with the support of administration. On 15 May 2019, an official order was issued by the authorities of Origin Taekwondo stating “Dr.Benson Gathoni, is designated as the Student Coordinator (Taekwondo), who will initiate the process of setting up of Martial Arts Taekwondo Academy as well as conduct of Taekwondo I Classes at DEKUT Townn Campus in consultation with Associate Professor (Physical Education) of the Institute”.

                <span>
                    On the day of 20th August 2019, director of the institute inaugurated the <em>dojo hall</em> at Central Block of DEKUT main campus. The dojo hall was allocated to the Academy for the conduction of classes of the Taekwondo practitioners. All the efforts, the founders and supporters gave for establishing the Martial Arts Origin Taekwondo proved worth it.
